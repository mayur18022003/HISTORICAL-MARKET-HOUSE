The Chola dynasty whose heartland was the fertile valley of Cauvery with  Thanjavur as its capital was one of the longest-ruling dynasties of South India – over 1500 years. The Chola dynasty spread to even parts of South East Asia – Maldives, Srilanka Malay Peninsula and Indonesia. Rajaraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola I were the greatest rulers of the Chola dynasty. The Chola kings were avid builders and continued the temple building traditions (Dravidian style) of the Pallavas. The Chola temple architecture is notable as much for its magnificence and grandeur as it is for its workmanship."

Pallavas were the most noted for temple architecture. They were instrumental in the transition from rock-cut architecture to stone temples. The most noted architectural accomplishments of Pallavas are at Mahabalipuram, which under the Pallava reign became an important centre of art, architecture and literature.Pancha Ratha (Five chariots) are monolithic stone chariot structures dedicated to the five Pandava brothers and their wife Draupadi. Structurally and architecturally all the rathas are sculpted differently from others."

The art and architecture during this period except for the Pataliputra palace, is mainly Ashokan. It can be classified mainly into Stupas, Pillars, Caves, Palaces and Pottery.The Art during the Mauryan era witnessed a major transformation – from use of wood to stone and also marked an impressive step forward in Indian stone sculpture.One of the finest examples of Mauryan sculpture, the magnificent Lion Capital at Sarnath has been adopted as the National Emblem of the modern Indian Republic. Samrat Ashoka who had embraced Buddhism, constructed numerous Stupas all over the country to celebrate the achievements of Gautam Buddha.The Stupa at Sanchi is one of the greatest examples of Stupas built in that period."
